# Long beach feline rescue

This is the repo for www.longbeachfelines.org

## TODO:

1. Fix donate buttons. (Links from the original website don't work on the new one)
2. Create netlify forms for:
    - Volunteering
    - Fostering
    - Adoption questionnaire
3. Add a "resources" page with more content. This is what the CMS will post content to. Maybe called "The Feline Feed". Resources page can also have other quick reference posts like "what to do if you find a stray cat".
4. Find more places to add cat pics.
5. Create CMS system with dedap or contentful.
6. Add some kind of SEO?
